Create the following using the language Python:
Build a simple looping command-line calculator that takes numbers and operations as the CLI arguments
this CLI application supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
using input from the arguments when the program is invoked. The calculator should:

0. Have a run method that will loop and ask the user for 2 inputs and an operation upon which to calculate
1. Accept two numbers and an operation as input
2. Perform the requested calculation
3. Handle division by zero gracefully
4. Support continuous calculations until the user chooses to exit
5. Display results with proper formatting
6. Maintain a history of calculations
7. Maintain a run which will loop and ask the user for 2 inputs and an operation
8. Handle user input that will be calculated

The application should be built using Python and follow object-oriented principles for maintainability and extensibility.
