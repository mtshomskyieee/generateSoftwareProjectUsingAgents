Create the following using HTML and javascript :
Build a simple fronte end calculator application that supports basic
arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) input from
the input /calculate. Use javascript to connect inputs from the page, calculate the results and present results.

The calculator should:

0. Have a run method that will loop and ask the user for 2 inputs and an operation upon which to calculate
1. Accept two numbers and an operation as input
2. Perform the requested calculation
3. Handle division by zero gracefully
4. Support continuous calculations until the user chooses to exit
5. Display results with proper formatting
6. Maintain a history of calculations
7. Maintain a run which will loop and ask the user for 2 inputs and an operation
8. Handle user input that will be calculated

The application should be built using HTML and javascript and follow best practices for maintainability and extensibility.
