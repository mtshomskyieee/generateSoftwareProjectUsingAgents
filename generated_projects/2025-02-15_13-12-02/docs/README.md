# Asteroids Game Documentation

This documentation provides comprehensive guidance on how to install, set up, and use the Asteroids Game implemented with HTML and JavaScript. It also covers available operations, example usages, error handling, and the history features of the game.

## 1. Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript

### Step-by-step Installation
1. **Download the Game Files**: Obtain the source code files for the Asteroids game. This typically includes an `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
   
2. **Create a Project Folder**: Create a new folder on your local machine and place all the downloaded files into this folder.

3. **Open in Browser**: Open the `index.html` file in your web browser:
   - You can do this by double-clicking the file, or by right-clicking and selecting "Open with" followed by your preferred web browser.

4. **Run the Game**: Once opened, the game should start running in your browser. You will see the spaceship and asteroids rendered on the canvas.

## 2. Available Operations

### Controls
- **Left Arrow (←)**: Rotate the spaceship counterclockwise.
- **Right Arrow (→)**: Rotate the spaceship clockwise.
- **Up Arrow (↑)**: Activate thrust, moving the spaceship forward.
- **Space Bar**: Fire a bullet from the spaceship.
- **S**: Activate/Deactivate the shield around the spaceship.

### Game Mechanics
- The spaceship can move and shoot bullets.
- Bullets can destroy small asteroids and make big asteroids smaller.
- The shield can destroy asteroids that come into contact with it.
- The canvas is designed to wrap around; if an object goes out of bounds, it reappears on the opposite side.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Moving the Spaceship
Press the **up arrow** key to activate thrust. The spaceship will move in the direction it is facing.

### Firing a Bullet
1. Position your spaceship towards an asteroid.
2. Press the **Space bar** to fire.
3. If you hit a small asteroid, it will be destroyed. If you hit a big asteroid, it will turn into two smaller asteroids.

### Activating the Shield
Press the **S** key to activate a shield around the spaceship. This shield will destroy any asteroid that comes into contact with it.

## 4. Error Handling Guide

### Common Issues
- **Game not starting**: Ensure the `index.html` file was opened in a web browser. If it does not launch, check for console errors using developer tools (F12).
  
- **Controls not responding**: Ensure that your keyboard is functioning correctly. Make sure your browser window is focused on the game canvas.

### Debugging Steps
- If the spaceship is not responding to controls, try refreshing the page (F5).
- Check the console for any JavaScript errors that might be preventing the game from functioning.

## 5. History Feature Usage

### History Tracking
The game can implement a history feature that keeps track of players' scores, number of asteroids destroyed, and other game events.

### How to Access History
- The history feature can be incorporated as a logging mechanism in the code where each relevant event (such as firing a bullet or destroying an asteroid) is logged into an array or displayed on the screen.
- You can modify the game code to access and display this history for player review after each game session.

By following this documentation, players should be able to effectively set up, navigate, and enjoy the gameplay of the Asteroids game. Happy gaming!
