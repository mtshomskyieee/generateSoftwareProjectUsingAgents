## 3. Usage Examples

### Basic Calculations
To perform a calculation, the application will prompt you for two numbers and the desired operation. Here are a few examples:

- **Add**:
   - Input: `3`, `5`, `add`
   - Output: `Result: 8`

- **Subtract**:
   - Input: `10`, `4`, `subtract`
   - Output: `Result: 6`

- **Multiply**:
   - Input: `6`, `7`, `multiply`
   - Output: `Result: 42`

- **Divide**:
   - Input: `12`, `4`, `divide`
   - Output: `Result: 3`

### Handling Division by Zero
If you attempt to divide by zero:
- **Input**: `10`, `0`, `divide`
- **Output**: `Error: Division by zero is not allowed!`

## 4. Error Handling Guide

### Common Errors
1. **Division by Zero**
   - When attempting to divide by zero, the application will return an error.
  
2. **Invalid Operation**
   - If an operation is entered that is not supported, the application will return an error.

### Error Messages
- Division by zero: "Error: Division by zero is not allowed!"
- Invalid operation: "Error: Invalid operation provided!"

## 5. History Feature Usage

The calculator maintains a history of all calculations performed during the session. To access the history:

1. **View History**: The calculator will automatically display a list of calculations once a calculation is completed.
   
2. **Clearing History**: If you wish to clear the history, you can invoke the clear history command. This will reset the history list to empty.

### Example of History Access
After performing calculations:
- Inputs: 
    1. `3`, `2`, `add`
    2. `5`, `2`, `subtract`
   
- Output: 
```
History:
1. 3 + 2 = 5
2. 5 - 2 = 3
```

### Clearing History Example
To clear the history:
- Input: `clear history`
- Output: `History cleared successfully.`

This documentation provides a clear and concise understanding of how to install, use, and troubleshoot the Calculator application. It allows users to leverage its full capabilities in performing basic arithmetic operations while maintaining a record of their calculations.
