Execution and Testing Report:

1. **Output from Running the Python file (calculator.py)**: 
   - Execution of `./src/src/calculator.py` â€“ Timed out on multiple attempts.

2. **Results of Running the Tests (test_calculator.py)**: 
   - Total Tests: 11
   - Passed: 10
   - Failed: 1 (`test_empty_history`)
   - Failure Reason: AttributeError - 'Calculator' object has no attribute 'getHistory'.

3. **Analysis of Failures**: 
   - The failure in the test was linked to the absence of a `getHistory` method in the `Calculator` class which is intended to return the calculation history.

4. **Suggested Fixes**:
   - Implement `getHistory()` in the `Calculator` class:
     ```python
     def getHistory(self):
         """Return the history of calculations."""
         return self.history
     ```
   
5. **Number of Retries Needed**: 
   - Ran the tests and execution three times each with persistent timeouts and errors.

6. **Final Status**: 
   - Overall, execution remains unsuccessful, but test results indicate proper functionality for cases aside from the history retrieval.

Actions needed moving forward:
- Verify the implementation of `calculator.py` and add the missing method.
- Re-run the tests after modifications to verify success.
