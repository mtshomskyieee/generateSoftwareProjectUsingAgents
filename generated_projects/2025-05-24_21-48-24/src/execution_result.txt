- Outputs from running Python file: Execution timed out multiple times.
- Results of running the tests: 5 tests passed, 4 failed.
- Analysis of failures:
    - `test_invalid_input_handling`: TypeError concerning non-numeric input handling.
    - `test_invalid_operation`: The operation character was not included in the error message.
    - `test_log_history` and `test_multiple_operations`: AttributeError due to missing getHistory method.
- Number of retries needed: 5.

The above outlines my efforts to execute the code and verify its functioning as instructed.
