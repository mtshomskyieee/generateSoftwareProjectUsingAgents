# Asteroids Game Documentation

## 1. Installation and Setup

To set up the Asteroids game locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Open your terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/asteroids-game.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder:**
   Change your directory to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd asteroids-game
   ```

3. **Open the HTML file:**
   Use any web browser to open `index.html` in your project directory. You can do this either by dragging the file into your browser or using the file explorer to navigate to it.

4. **Ensure you have JavaScript enabled:**
   Make sure your browser settings allow JavaScript to run.

Now you are ready to play the game!

## 2. Available Operations

The game provides several controls for player interaction:

- **Rotate Left:** Press `Left Arrow` to rotate the spaceship counterclockwise.
- **Rotate Right:** Press `Right Arrow` to rotate the spaceship clockwise.
- **Thrust:** Press `Up Arrow` to add thrust in the direction the spaceship is facing.
- **Fire:** Press the `Space` key to fire a bullet from the spaceship.
- **Shield:** Press the `S` key to toggle the shield on and off.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Move and Fire:
- Use the `Up Arrow` to move forward, while rotating with the `Left Arrow` or `Right Arrow`. 
- Press `Space` to shoot bullets at approaching asteroids.

### Activate Shield:
- Press `S` to activate the shield. You can see a circle around the spaceship while it's active.

### Asteroid Interaction:
1. If a **bullet** hits a **small asteroid**, the asteroid is destroyed.
2. If a **bullet** hits a **big asteroid**, the asteroid will split into two smaller asteroids.

### Boundary Wrapping:
Both the spaceship and asteroids can exit one side of the canvas and re-enter from the opposite side, maintaining continuous gameplay.

## 4. Error Handling Guide

While playing, you may encounter the following issues:

- **Asteroids not spawning:** If asteroids do not appear, refresh the page. Ensure your browser's JavaScript console does not show errors.
- **Controls unresponsive:** Check if the game is in focus; click on the canvas to activate it.
- **Game not loading:** Verify that you're opening the HTML file correctly in your browser and that JavaScript is enabled.

## 5. History Feature Usage

Currently, the game does not implement a traditional "history feature." However, you can interact with objects and keep track of what actions you've taken (e.g., number of asteroids destroyed, number of bullets fired, etc.). 

For developers, consider maintaining an in-game log that captures player stats by revisiting the game logic in JavaScript. You can track scores, bullets fired, and asteroids destroyed using global variables or a simple logging mechanism.

### Example of Tracking:
You can implement a score counter in JavaScript as follows:
```javascript
var score = 0;

// When hitting an asteroid
function updateScore() {
    score += 100; // Example scoring logic
}
```

By following this guide, you should be up and running with the Asteroids game, fully equipped to play and understand the available operations. Enjoy navigating space and blasting those asteroids!
